Forked the Statistical Arbitrage Project from Imperial College Student Investment Fund, to which I personally contributed (+40% of the code) during the Academic Year 2019/2020. The objective is back-testing a pair trading strategy and evaluating performance on long-short US equity portfolio. I am currently refactoring the whole code, with the addition of new classes and radical changes in the existing ones. Code readability and functionality was significantly improved as a result, and I am the sole owner of the project now.
